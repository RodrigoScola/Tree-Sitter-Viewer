# Tree-Sitter Viewer

## Supported Languages

currently the support for languages are:

-    Javascript

-    Typescript

-    JSON

-    Golang

## DISCLAIMER

This is a very simple tree sitter lexical viewer. It is made with the intention not to be a viewer or query builder, rather to help me develop text extensions in vscode, such as (https://github.com/RodrigoScola/vscode-text-objects)[vscode text objects].

I dont know how my interest will continue with this projects after my needs are met. if you want to use this extension use it at your own will.
